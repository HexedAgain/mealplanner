Use Google Firestore (or equivalent) to store recipes
The app should be able to list recipes
The app shold be able to search recipes by the following criteria:
  - Exact name (or approx name)
  - Ingredients (excluded and included + tolerance (i.e. accept maybe one missing ingredient, or add one ingredient))
  - Time to cook
  - Difficulty
  - Price (this might have to be determined app side)
  - Recipe author
At each cooking step the app should raise a notification
User should be able to add their own tags locally or maybe define their own difficulty rankings
Recipes should be stored locally in a Room database (or other database)
User should be able to amend a recipe locally
User should be able to publish their own amendments as a new recipe, in addition to posting new recipes
Need some way of providing images
Need some way of serving audio only versions of these recipes, or otherwise dictating text in audio form
App needs to define a set of ingredients, or this set needs to be stored remotely.
  There shoul be the ability to update this set over time.
The app will be able to present ingredient quantities in the users preferred metric system (i.e. convert lbs to kgs and so on...)
Recipe schema:
  [name], [name-also]*, [ingredients]*, [step]*, [step-time], [step-title], [step-body], [step-image/url], [step-appliances], [step-cookware]
The currently active step should be a different colour to the other steps
Would be nice if users could share by nearby p2p
User should be able to plan a recipe schedule (i.e. food they will be eating this week)
Maybe user can create recipes locally for free, access to database should be paid for (helps toward ongoing cost). Maybe the app defines a small set of recipes
In app, each step should present a form allowing user to specifiy things like time, ingredients, etc ...
Maybe each recipe states its calories, protein, etc... nutrition stats can be provided on a weekly basis
